He is a long-time student of Game Design Theory, and a life-long gamer with high reverence for the great productions of the early 90's.He has been involved in the indie game development and protoyping scene for around 7 years. He is the holder of a Professional-Bachelor's degree in Architecture from the University of Notre Dame with an emphasis on historic and traditional design. He has done work in classically-oriented architecture and landscape architecture firms on the US east coast and in Belgium, and has contributed to historic architectural survey work for the Prince's Foundation. He is also an adept at several commercial game engines and computer modeling suites, and an amateur musician and composer. Mark Harbaugh, age 31, does Code, Prototyping, Scripting, and Design for Aloft. He has been writing code for over 13 years now, and is fluent in C\#, C++, Javascript, HTML, PHP, Actionscript, GML, and Clojure, as well as Assembly and Machine language. For almost as long, he has been putting those skills to work prototyping around a dozen of his own game concepts. Mark pursues game development as a way of balancing his interest and proficiency in computer science with his strong creative impulse. He has a great love for the idea of games as a vehicle for storytelling and world building, as well as a careful hand for the minutia of a functional game structure. Mark is a long-time student of the mechanics of classic-era game engines, and their common solutions, and brings this knowledge to bear in invoking the feel of these great titles by learning from their solutions. Shannon Mason, (AKA \"Pongball\"), age 35, is joining us as a composer for Hazelnut Bastille. She is a lifelong composer who has worked on indie and casual mobile games for around 7 years. Shannon writes in a wide range of musical styles, but has found a particular niche in the romanticism of the 16 bit era. Through her close understanding of the writing techniques and character of the time, she has managed to create a sound which is a direct continuation of the lineage of the great 16 bit soundtracks, rather than merely an imitation of them.

As an independent artist focused on instrumental works, Gustaf composes, records and performs ambient, looping, electronic post-rock. As a founding member of the power-trio Maximum Indifference in the late ’90’s, Gustaf composed and performed a unique body of cinematic instrumental rock music. By 2009, Gustaf had completed his inaugural solo release, METAMESMERIC, which featured his live-looping approach on the bass cello. In 2015, Gustaf released INTENTION, a collection of ambient, down tempo, post-rock pieces. The music composed for INTENTION represents a full-spectrum approach, incorporating ambient textures, nostalgic washes of analog synth, layers of live drums and programmed rhythms, etherial vocals, and rich, luxurious bass guitar. To support the release of this album, one that is sure to establish Gustaf’s voice in the genre. INTENTION is an exploration of complex soundscapes composed to evoke a mature and layered musical narrative evocative of the many layered emotional and rational components that create intent and purpose in each of our lives. In 2016 Gustaf began writing and recording the follow-up to INTENTION. BY the fall he had amassed enough material for more that two albums. As the material organized itself into two groupings, there were a few tracks that didn’t quite fit with either grouping, so he released those on the EP DIAMETRIC in the fall of 2016. Gustaf quick turned his focus back to finishing off the first grouping and in March of 2016 it was completed. THE PERIPHERAL ARC: VOLUME I is the first in what will eventually be a three-album cycle. It continues on the trajectory of some of the higher energy moments of INTENTION, while delving deeper into the realms of ambient bass guitar, analog synths, and lush, etherial textures (and of course, massive regular bass!). THE PERIPHERAL ARC: VOLUME I is due out in August of 2017 on Vinyl, Compact Disc, and Digital.The album is the latest in Gustaf’s journey of musical composition that blends sound and emotion to create fundamental audio narratives.", google_analytics: "")

Natalija is Bosnian and Serbian and immigrated to Chicago when she was six years old. She’s convinced that not being able to speak English didn’t just ostracize her from her classmates, but taught her to be a keen observer and sparked her love of storytelling. Dreaming up stories was a way to regain her voice and make sense of her new home. Natalija writes and adapts screenplays for film and television about true or historic events from the perspective of outsiders, misfits and women who shape history, but are often forgotten. She loves to tackle complex and gritty female characters. She is working on “Bop City,” a dramatic pilot about the smoky, sexy, seedy and vibrant Jazz scene of 1950s San Francisco Fillmore district, which was destroyed by redevelopment.", google_analytics: "")

Having my first experience with art as a child, being involved with a school mural project opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking about life. Throughout my childhood growing up never loosing the desire to create art, at times I just never had the opportunities before me. For me art became a voice and self identity. As an artist I strive to communicate to society, my community, and people with different backgrounds. I communicate through my visual art, performance, and conceptual art. Art is about creating the conversations visually and mentally with the subject matter I present. Art cannot deny the environment that it is in, so I continue to paint who I am, what I see and what my thoughts reside in. I continue to stay a student of life, push myself to be innovative and relevant with my art so it can have meaning to those that experience it. Everything to me is art, however you view life, can be seen as art, so I have no preference to which medium is used. Having my first small showing downtown Phoenix in 2007, since then I have progressed to doing solo shows at established galleries and museums. In 2010, I developed my “Sound in Color” art, where I showcased the art of B-Boying (Break Dancing), I orchestrated for a live DJ to play music while the dancers responded to beats. This concept was discovered by Independent Curators International to be showcased in a traveling exhibit “The Peoples Biennial”. The show traveled from Portland, Arizona, North Carolina, South Dakota and Pennsylvania. Being able to highlight my dance with my art expression was a great achievement for me. In 2011 I was recognized for my attributes to Phoenix by the Phoenix New Times magazine’s Big Brain Awards which are given out once a year to individuals adding to their city. As a child I was influenced by the art, so for me to give back was always a dream. In 2011 with the collaboration of Arizona State University and Phoenix Center for the Arts we developed “The Rise Project”, which was a vision I had developed and implanted with the two organizations. For me art is a voice to speak to the people and hopefully I can utilize the voice to inspire and motivate.", google_analytics: "")

I returned to Canada a few years later to briefly dance with Alberta Ballet before finally separating from classical ballet to dance as a soloist for La La La Human Steps in Montreal. At La La La, I participated in both on stage and on screen production of Amelia, Les Boreades and Amjad. In between La La La Human Steps productions, I studied acting in New York City and danced with Hubbard Street Dance Chicago in works by Ohad Naharin, William Forsythe, Nacho Duato and Lar Lubovitch. I returned to Montreal to dance with LaLaLa and then, after the birth of my son in 2009, I completed at degree in Urban Planning at Concordia University. Currently, I am working in Montreal as a freelance dancer on creative collaborations and independent film projects.

In 1975 he started Maringer Custom Cutlery and made beautiful hand-crafted knives and swords. Beginning in 1987 he began making fantasy postage stamps, and in 2001 acquired his first press for the making of fantasy coins. Beginning strictly as a fan-art hobby project, fantasy coinmaking grew into a more serious project for Tom with the success his licensed A Game of Thrones™ series beginning in 2003. Today Shire Post Mint is a traditional fantasy coin making mint with four full time staff specializing in the fabrication of fully-licensed fantasy currency from fictional worlds, including George R.R. Martin\'s "A Game of Thrones" series, Robert E Howard’s "Conan™" series, "The Hobbit™" and "The Lord of the Rings™" trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan’s "The Wheel of Time™" series, L.E. Modesitt’s "The Saga of Recluce™" series, Patrick Rothfuss’ "The Kingkiller Chronicle™" series, Peter V. Brett\'s "The Demon Cycle" series, and Edgar Rice Burroughs’ "John Carter of Mars™" series. Shire Post utilizes antique coin making processes to recreate the feel and look of ancient and medieval coins, from hand-carving dies, using solid metals (never cast or plated), stamping with antique machines, to tumbling and chemically or thermally treating the coins in order to bring about the weathered look of old coins. Our primary goal is to increase fans\' immersive experience in their favorite fantasies by creating simple tactile objects to enhance the sense-of-place and contribute to a state of "Suspension Of Disbelief" or "SOD" with respect to the beloved fantasy realm. Our goal was fully realized when a fan commented: "I thought those stories were made up... but these coins are REAL!" We hope that everybody may be enabled to experience such a SOD experience, even if it\'s only for a moment.

This young prodigy was soon invited to perform with many of the nation’s top jazz musicians. By the age of 21, Silberstein has won the coveted “Israeli Jazz Player of The Year” title. Soon after, he performed at Italy’s renowned Umbria Jazz Festival, released a critically acclaimed debut album and set out on an extensive tour of Europe and the Middle East. Upon receiving a scholarship to the prestigious New School, Yotam Silberstein moved to New York in 2005. Praise continued to pour in as a finalist in the 2005 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Guitar Competition with one critic noting, “Yotam’s tones are exquisitely old school but his playing fresh, fiery and bursting with joyful exuberance, and musically he is one heavy cat.” Jazz Times noted, “Since his arrival in New York in 2005, Israeli guitarist Yotam Silberstein has made an impact on the scene with his precision bebop lines and fleet fingered improvisation. All About Jazz summed up his 2009 release, “Next Page” as “unadorned hollow-body guitar work freely invites comparison to releases from the heyday of Blue Note Records. He isn’t piggy backing on memories. He’s forging his own path with skills and style.” As artistically gifted as he is technically proficient, Silberstein is featured on a wide variety of critically acclaimed releases including “Resonance” and “Brasil” on the Jazz Legacy Productions label and Monty Alexander’s Grammy-nominated “Harlem-Kingston Express Live!” In just six years since arriving in the Big Apple, internationally acclaimed Yotam Silberstein has earned his place among the jazz elite by collaborating with such luminaries as James Moody, The Heath Brothers, Paquito D’ Rivera, Monty Alexander, Roy Hargrove, and the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars. This versatile guitarist’s wheelhouse runs the sonic spectrum from the straight ahead to Brazilian, world music, blues and bebop. Silberstein’s showmanship wowed the Kennedy Center’s 2011 production, “Ella!” which featured Dee Dee Bridgewater, Al Jarreau, Dr. Billy Taylor and Janis Siegel. His performance earned him a return invitation for a special appearance at the KC Jazz Club. In addition, Yotam Silberstein has toured as a leader in major clubs in Europe, Japan, and Singapore while winning the Sundance Time Warner award for film music. Having performed with the world’s premier talent, he has honed his craft with precision, finesse and the innate artistic touch that others twice his age are still searching for to this day there is little doubt among critics that Yotam Silberstein’s musical stock is an arrow pointing straight up!', google_analytics: "")

L’artwork de l’EP a été réalisé par Roberto TODERICO qui a notamment travaillé pour des groupes tels que SINISTER, ASPHYX, CUT UP, SOULBURN, TYGERS OF PAN TANG ou encore PESTILENCE. 1 an plus tard après une centaine de passage en RADIO FM et beaucoup de chroniques positives qui les ont amenés à donner des interviews en direct du HELLFEST 2018, Antagonism prépare la sortie de son premier album : World On Disease', google_analytics: "")
