He is a long-time student of Game Design Theory, and a life-long gamer with high reverence for the great productions of the early 90's.He has been involved in the indie game development and protoyping scene for around 7 years. He is the holder of a Professional-Bachelor's degree in Architecture from the University of Notre Dame with an emphasis on historic and traditional design. He has done work in classically-oriented architecture and landscape architecture firms on the US east coast and in Belgium, and has contributed to historic architectural survey work for the Prince's Foundation. He is also an adept at several commercial game engines and computer modeling suites, and an amateur musician and composer. Mark Harbaugh, age 31, does Code, Prototyping, Scripting, and Design for Aloft. He has been writing code for over 13 years now, and is fluent in C\#, C++, Javascript, HTML, PHP, Actionscript, GML, and Clojure, as well as Assembly and Machine language. For almost as long, he has been putting those skills to work prototyping around a dozen of his own game concepts. Mark pursues game development as a way of balancing his interest and proficiency in computer science with his strong creative impulse. He has a great love for the idea of games as a vehicle for storytelling and world building, as well as a careful hand for the minutia of a functional game structure. Mark is a long-time student of the mechanics of classic-era game engines, and their common solutions, and brings this knowledge to bear in invoking the feel of these great titles by learning from their solutions. Shannon Mason, (AKA \"Pongball\"), age 35, is joining us as a composer for Hazelnut Bastille. She is a lifelong composer who has worked on indie and casual mobile games for around 7 years. Shannon writes in a wide range of musical styles, but has found a particular niche in the romanticism of the 16 bit era. Through her close understanding of the writing techniques and character of the time, she has managed to create a sound which is a direct continuation of the lineage of the great 16 bit soundtracks, rather than merely an imitation of them.

As an independent artist focused on instrumental works, Gustaf composes, records and performs ambient, looping, electronic post-rock. As a founding member of the power-trio Maximum Indifference in the late ’90’s, Gustaf composed and performed a unique body of cinematic instrumental rock music. By 2009, Gustaf had completed his inaugural solo release, METAMESMERIC, which featured his live-looping approach on the bass cello. In 2015, Gustaf released INTENTION, a collection of ambient, down tempo, post-rock pieces. The music composed for INTENTION represents a full-spectrum approach, incorporating ambient textures, nostalgic washes of analog synth, layers of live drums and programmed rhythms, etherial vocals, and rich, luxurious bass guitar. To support the release of this album, one that is sure to establish Gustaf’s voice in the genre. INTENTION is an exploration of complex soundscapes composed to evoke a mature and layered musical narrative evocative of the many layered emotional and rational components that create intent and purpose in each of our lives. In 2016 Gustaf began writing and recording the follow-up to INTENTION. BY the fall he had amassed enough material for more that two albums. As the material organized itself into two groupings, there were a few tracks that didn’t quite fit with either grouping, so he released those on the EP DIAMETRIC in the fall of 2016. Gustaf quick turned his focus back to finishing off the first grouping and in March of 2016 it was completed. THE PERIPHERAL ARC: VOLUME I is the first in what will eventually be a three-album cycle. It continues on the trajectory of some of the higher energy moments of INTENTION, while delving deeper into the realms of ambient bass guitar, analog synths, and lush, etherial textures (and of course, massive regular bass!). THE PERIPHERAL ARC: VOLUME I is due out in August of 2017 on Vinyl, Compact Disc, and Digital.The album is the latest in Gustaf’s journey of musical composition that blends sound and emotion to create fundamental audio narratives.", websites: nil, google_analytics: nil)

Having my first experience with art as a child, being involved with a school mural project opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking about life. Throughout my childhood growing up never loosing the desire to create art, at times I just never had the opportunities before me. For me art became a voice and self identity. As an artist I strive to communicate to society, my community, and people with different backgrounds. I communicate through my visual art, performance, and conceptual art. Art is about creating the conversations visually and mentally with the subject matter I present. Art cannot deny the environment that it is in, so I continue to paint who I am, what I see and what my thoughts reside in. I continue to stay a student of life, push myself to be innovative and relevant with my art so it can have meaning to those that experience it. Everything to me is art, however you view life, can be seen as art, so I have no preference to which medium is used. Having my first small showing downtown Phoenix in 2007, since then I have progressed to doing solo shows at established galleries and museums. In 2010, I developed my “Sound in Color” art, where I showcased the art of B-Boying (Break Dancing), I orchestrated for a live DJ to play music while the dancers responded to beats. This concept was discovered by Independent Curators International to be showcased in a traveling exhibit “The Peoples Biennial”. The show traveled from Portland, Arizona, North Carolina, South Dakota and Pennsylvania. Being able to highlight my dance with my art expression was a great achievement for me. In 2011 I was recognized for my attributes to Phoenix by the Phoenix New Times magazine’s Big Brain Awards which are given out once a year to individuals adding to their city. As a child I was influenced by the art, so for me to give back was always a dream. In 2011 with the collaboration of Arizona State University and Phoenix Center for the Arts we developed “The Rise Project”, which was a vision I had developed and implanted with the two organizations. For me art is a voice to speak to the people and hopefully I can utilize the voice to inspire and motivate.", websites: nil, google_analytics: nil)
